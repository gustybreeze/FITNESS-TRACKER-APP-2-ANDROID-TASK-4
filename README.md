**Fitness Tracker App**

This project simulates a Fitness Tracker App using Python. It mimics tracking steps, distance covered, and calories burned using synthetic sensor data in the absence of real Android sensors. The app is built for command-line execution and includes backend logic for processing and analyzing mock fitness activity data.


**Folder Structure** 

fitness_tracker_app/
- Inside the fitness_tracker_app folder, the following key files are present:

- main.py – Acts as the entry point. It initializes and runs the app.

- data_generator.py – Simulates real-time activity data (steps, distance, calories).

- tracker.py – Core logic to process generated data and produce summaries.

- requirements.txt – Lists Python packages needed to run the app.


**Features**

- Generates mock fitness data periodically (steps, distance in km, calories).

- Tracks and summarizes daily totals.

- Designed to demonstrate real-time updates via console or logs.

- Modular structure for easy extension into a GUI or mobile app in future.


**Technology Stack**

- Python 3.x

- Standard Libraries: time, random, datetime, etc.

- No external sensor libraries required


**Output**

- Live data points such as steps, distance, and calories appear in intervals.

- Summary reports are generated after the simulation ends or on user stop.

- You can tweak the simulation speed and data limits in data_generator.py.


**Notes**

- This app is for educational and prototype purposes.

- No real sensors are used — all data is artificially generated.

- Can be adapted for desktop GUI or mobile app integration (e.g., Kivy, Android).
